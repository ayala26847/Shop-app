## Phase 6: Migration Execution

### 6.1 Gradual Migration Strategy
1. **Week 1-2**: Migrate User entity completely
2. **Week 3-4**: Migrate Product entity
3. **Week 5-6**: Migrate Cart and Order entities
4. **Week 7-8**: Migrate remaining entities
5. **Week 9-10**: Performance optimization
6. **Week 11-12**: Testing and cleanup

### 6.2 Migration Steps for Each Entity

#### Step 1: Create New Entity Structure
```bash
# Create entity folder structure
mkdir -p src/entities/{entity-name}/{api,model,lib,ui}
```

#### Step 2: Implement Types and Interfaces
- Create entity types in `model/types.ts`
- Define API interfaces
- Set up validation schemas

#### Step 3: Implement API Layer
- Create RTK Query API in `api/{entity}-api.ts`
- Set up endpoints and hooks
- Configure caching strategies

#### Step 4: Implement Service Layer
- Create service class in `lib/{entity}-service.ts`
- Implement business logic
- Add error handling

#### Step 5: Create UI Components
- Build entity-specific components
- Implement forms and displays
- Add accessibility features

#### Step 6: Add Tests
- Write unit tests for service
- Create integration tests
- Add component tests

#### Step 7: Update Dependencies
- Update imports in existing code
- Replace old implementations
- Remove deprecated code

2. **API Changes**: Versioned APIs with backward compatibility
3. **Performance Impact**: Continuous monitoring and optimization
4. **Testing Coverage**: Automated testing with quality gates

### Rollback Strategy
1. **Feature Flags**: Enable/disable new features
2. **API Versioning**: Maintain old API versions
3. **Database Migrations**: Reversible migrations
4. **Deployment Strategy**: Blue-green deployments
